# Pipeline control REST API (dashboard Start / Stop)

The agent runs on the office machine, behind the office router: nothing on the internet can call it. So the dashboard
calls this **REST API** (folder `api/` in this repo, hosted on any server), which records the requested state in the
database. The agent checks the database every 5 seconds over its own outbound connection, applies the request, and
writes back what it is doing plus a heartbeat.

```
dashboard frontend ─▶ dashboard backend ──HTTPS──▶ pipeline API ──▶ Supabase Postgres ◀── office agent
   (its own repo)       (its own repo)              (api/, hosted)    pipeline_control     (polls every 5 s,
                                                                                            reports + heartbeat)
```

Nothing runs on a schedule: the pipeline runs only between Start and Stop.

## Connection

| | |
|---|---|
| Base URL | where the API is hosted, e.g. `https://marketing-agent-pipeline-api.onrender.com` (see `api/README.md`) |
| Auth | header `Authorization: Bearer <PIPELINE_API_TOKEN>` on every `/api/v1/*` route |
| Format | JSON. `start` / `stop` take an optional body `{"requested_by": "<dashboard user>"}` (max 100 chars) |
| Interactive docs | `<base URL>/docs` (Swagger UI); machine-readable spec at `<base URL>/openapi.json` |

Call it from the dashboard **backend**, so the token never reaches a browser. If a browser must call it directly, list
the dashboard's origin in the API's `PIPELINE_API_CORS_ORIGINS`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/pipeline/start` | Ask the agent to start. Already asked: nothing changes (`"changed": false`). |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/pipeline/stop` | Ask the agent to stop. It cancels the pass in progress (for example a lead search). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/pipeline/status` | What the agent is doing. Poll every 5–10 s while the page is open. |
| `GET` | `/health` | `{"status": "ok"}` when the API is up. No token. Says nothing about the office machine. |

Start and Stop are **requests**: they return at once, and the agent applies them within about 5 seconds (stopping
can take up to 30 s while the current step winds down). The response shows the request (`desired_state`) and what the
agent was doing at that moment (`state`); poll `status` until `in_sync` is true.

If the office machine is off, the request is kept and applied when it comes back online.

## Response body

`status` returns the object below; `start` and `stop` return the same plus `changed`.

```json
{
  "desired_state": "running",
  "state": "running",
  "online": true,
  "in_sync": true,
  "requested_by": "dashboard:akshat@example.com",
  "requested_at": "2026-10-07T05:12:38.512000Z",
  "state_since": "2026-10-07T05:12:40Z",
  "current_pass": { "started_at": "2026-10-07T05:12:40Z", "step": "leads" },
  "next_pass_at": null,
  "last_pass": {
    "started_at": "2026-10-07T04:20:02+00:00",
    "finished_at": "2026-10-07T04:58:31+00:00",
    "outcome": "succeeded",
    "result": { "leads": { "searches": 12, "leads_qualified": 4, "emails_drafted": 3, "approvals_requested": 3 } }
  },
  "sending_enabled": true,
  "test_mode": true,
  "agent_host": "office-machine",
  "heartbeat_at": "2026-10-07T05:20:11.204000Z",
  "changed": true
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `desired_state` | What the dashboard last asked for: `"running"` or `"stopped"`. |
| `state` | What the agent is doing: `"running"`, `"stopped"`, or `"offline"` when its last heartbeat is older than 60 s. |
| `online` | `false`: the office machine is off, asleep, has no network, or the agent service is stopped. |
| `in_sync` | `true` once the agent has applied `desired_state`. |
| `requested_by`, `requested_at` | Who pressed the button last, and when. |
| `state_since` | When the agent last started or stopped (`null` when offline). |
| `current_pass` | The pass in progress, or `null`. `step` is one of `inbox`, `replies`, `send`, `followups`, `leads`, `blog`. |
| `next_pass_at` | While running, between two passes: when the next one starts. Otherwise `null`. |
| `last_pass` | The last finished pass, or `null`. `outcome`: `succeeded`, `failed` or `stopped`. It has `result` (numbers per step; a step that failed has an `error` key) or `error`. |
| `sending_enabled` | `false` means approved emails are not sent at all. |
| `test_mode` | `true` means every email goes to the test inbox, not to the real contact. |
| `agent_host`, `heartbeat_at` | Which machine reported, and when. |
| `changed` | (`start` / `stop` only) `false` when that state had already been requested. |

All times are UTC, ISO 8601.

### Suggested UI

| Condition | Show |
|---|---|
| `!online` | "Agent offline" (and, if `desired_state` is `running`: "will start when it comes back") |
| `online && !in_sync` | "Starting…" / "Stopping…", buttons disabled |
| `in_sync && state == "running"` | Stop button; `current_pass.step`, or "next pass at `next_pass_at`" |
| `in_sync && state == "stopped"` | Start button |

## Errors

Errors have the body `{"detail": "<message>"}`.

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `401` | Missing or wrong token. |
| `405` | Wrong method (`GET` for `status`, `POST` for `start` and `stop`). |
| `422` | Invalid body (for example `requested_by` longer than 100 characters). |
| `500` | The database is not reachable, or the agent's migrations were not applied. |
| `503` | `PIPELINE_API_TOKEN` is not set on the API. |

## What "running" means

- Passes run one after another, 30 minutes apart. A pass is: Gmail inbox → replies → send approved → follow-ups →
  lead discovery → blog (at most one blog post a day).
- Emails approved in Slack go out within about 20 seconds; Gmail is polled every 10 minutes.

While stopped, nothing is searched, drafted, sent or polled. Approve/Reject in Slack still records the decision (Slack
talks to Supabase, not to the office machine), and those emails go out after the next start.

## Examples

```bash
BASE=https://marketing-agent-pipeline-api.onrender.com
TOKEN=...   # PIPELINE_API_TOKEN
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"requested_by": "akshat"}' $BASE/api/v1/pipeline/start
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $BASE/api/v1/pipeline/stop
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $BASE/api/v1/pipeline/status
```

```js
// Dashboard backend (Node 18+)
const BASE = `${process.env.AGENT_API_URL}/api/v1/pipeline`;
const auth = { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.AGENT_API_TOKEN}` };
const post = (path, user) =>
  fetch(`${BASE}/${path}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { ...auth, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ requested_by: user }),
  }).then((r) => r.json());

export const pipelineStatus = () => fetch(`${BASE}/status`, { headers: auth }).then((r) => r.json());
export const startPipeline = (user) => post("start", user);
export const stopPipeline = (user) => post("stop", user);
```

Without the dashboard (any machine with the agent's `.env`): `python -m agent pipeline start|stop|status`, or from the
laptop `bash deploy/remote.sh pipeline start|stop|status`.
